# Rehab-HandballVR
Repository with data from a serious handball VR game for upper limb rehabilitation. Contains recorded kinematics for 9 participants across two exercises in an experimental session.

# VR Rehabilitation Exercise Data Repository

## Description
This repository contains detailed CSV files for each participant in the Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation exercise study conducted at the National Paraplegic Hospital in Toledo. These files encapsulate the kinematic data and recorded events — including saves and goals — from two distinct exercise sessions designed for patients with spinal cord injuries undergoing upper limb rehabilitation.

## Repository Contents
- **Individual CSV Files**: Each file corresponds to a participant, identified by a unique ID. The files include comprehensive kinematic data covering left and right arm movements, head, and trunk positions, along with their range points.
- **Event Data**: Recorded events such as the number of saves made by the participant and the goals conceded during each exercise session.
- **Session Comparison**: The data enables a comparative analysis between the first and the second exercise sessions, illustrating changes and improvements in participants' performance.
- **Visualization Support**: The CSV format allows for easy import into various data analysis and visualization tools, facilitating a deeper understanding of the kinematic behavior and exercise outcomes.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide a rich dataset for researchers and therapists interested in VR rehabilitation technologies. By analyzing this data, insights can be drawn into the effectiveness of VR exercises in improving mobility and motor skills of individuals with spinal cord injuries. It also serves as a valuable resource for further research and development in the field of VR-based rehabilitation.

## How to Use
- Download the CSV files corresponding to the participants you wish to analyze.
- Utilize data analysis tools to explore kinematic patterns, participant performance, and improvements across sessions.
- Compare and contrast the data to identify trends and insights relevant to VR rehabilitation practices.

We welcome researchers and practitioners to utilize this data in their studies and interventions, contributing to the advancement of VR technologies in rehabilitation therapy.
